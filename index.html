          <li><strong>September 2020</strong> - We took different strands on senior high. I took HUMSS because I really wanted to improve my public speaking while you took STEM because you just want to.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>July 2022</strong> - We met after 2 years for a debut celebration of one of our friends and nothing has ever changed. We still have the same vibes as we have left in 2019.

          </li>
          <li> That's it so far, I really appreciate everything we have done so far and I wouldn't be tired to be here for you. We may have encountered problems that we have dealt alone
            , there might be some times that we feel alone but I'll make sure none of us feels that way. We are two or none.
